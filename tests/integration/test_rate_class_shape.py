"""Validation tests for the per-class BNS rate curve shape.

Section 7 of ``grb_main.ipynb`` produces ``Plots/rate_bns_by_class.{pdf,png}``,
where the cyan ``sbGRB + blue KN`` channel exhibits a peak near z ~ 1.5, a
~10x dip near z ~ 4-5, and a recovery near z ~ 7.  The author's caption
attributes this to low-Z formation-channel dominance for the lightest BNS
systems (M_tot < 1.2 * M_TOV); the existing additivity test
``test_per_class_rates_partition_total_bns_2024`` is silent about whether
the shape is a numerical artifact.

The two tests in this file close that gap on the actual production curve:

(1) ``test_sbGRB_rate_dip_redshift_binning_invariant`` recomputes
    ``R_sbGRB(z)`` at production binning (dz = 0.01) and at a 2x refined
    grid (dz = 0.005), with a matched physical Gaussian kernel
    (``smooth_sigma * dz = 0.30``).  Asserts the dip and the two peaks
    land at the same redshifts (within ~5 production bins) and that the
    contrast ratios ``R_peak1 / R_dip`` and ``R_peak2 / R_dip`` agree
    across binnings to within 15%.  Tested as a contrast invariant
    rather than absolute amplitude because
    ``calibrate_mean_mass_evolved`` uses ``smooth_sigma=30`` in BIN
    units, so its boundary-reflective Gaussian at z=0 mixes in a
    different slice of R(z) at different ``redshift_step``, drifting
    the calibration constant and every downstream amplitude with it.
    Shape (locations, contrast ratios) is what the "is the dip a
    binning artifact" question actually asks about, and shape is
    invariant under that calibration drift.

(2) ``test_sbGRB_rate_dip_n_eff_above_threshold`` evaluates
    ``per_system_rate_weights`` at the dip redshift and asserts the
    weighted-sample ``N_eff = (sum w_i)^2 / sum w_i^2`` is comfortably
    above the few-binary regime that would make the curve sensitive to
    individual STROOPWAFEL outliers.

Both tests are gated on ``Data/COMPASCompactOutput_BNS_A.h5`` (via the
``bns_a_path`` fixture in ``conftest.py``) and on the upstream
``compas_python_utils`` package (via ``pytest.importorskip``); they skip
cleanly on machines lacking either.  Each test runs at least one full
Madau and Dickinson SFR convolution at production resolution and is
therefore marked ``slow``.

    """The cyan sbGRB + blue KN dip-and-recovery structure must persist
    under a 2x redshift-grid refinement.

    Tested in two complementary ways:

    1. CONTRAST-RATIO invariance (``R_peak / R_dip``).  The shape-vs-
       scale separation is what "is the dip a binning artifact"
       actually asks about: a real feature has a redshift-stable depth
       *relative* to the surrounding peaks, regardless of any overall
       scaling.  Empirically these ratios are stable to ~0.01% across
       dz = 0.01, 0.005, 0.0025 with the matched physical kernel below.

    2. ABSOLUTE-AMPLITUDE invariance (``R_dip``, ``R_peak2``).  After
       the ``smooth_sigma=0`` calibration fix in
       ``calibrate_mean_mass_evolved`` (sharp z=0 anchor matching
       Broekgaarden+ 2021 w_000), MEAN_MASS_EVOLVED no longer drifts
       with redshift_step, so the per-class rate amplitudes are also
       binning-stable when smoothing is applied with a matched physical
       kernel.  Pre-fix this assertion failed at +38.9%; the 10%
       threshold below leaves headroom for finite-dz residuals.  See
       ``test_calibrated_rate_matches_expected_local_rate_at_z0`` for
       the calibration-anchor regression that complements this one.

    Tolerance choices:
      - At each grid: ``R_peak1 / R_dip > 5x`` and ``R_peak2 / R_dip > 2x``
        (the user observes ~10x at the first peak; 5x is a conservative
        flattening floor).
      - z_dip stable to within 5 production bins (Delta z < 0.05);
        z_peak1 / z_peak2 stable within 10 bins (broader features).
      - p1/d and p2/d contrast ratios stable to within 15%, matching the
        shape tolerance used in
        ``test_compute_merger_rate_matches_compas_shape``.
      - ``R_dip`` and ``R_peak2`` absolute amplitudes stable to within
        10% (post-calibration-fix only).
